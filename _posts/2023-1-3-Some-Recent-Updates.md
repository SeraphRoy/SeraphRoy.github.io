* Add support for TOC in my [Jekyll theme](https://github.com/SeraphRoy/GaeBlogx "")
* Move domain name from [https://www.gaeblogx.com](https://www.gaeblogx.com "") to [https://www.gaeblog.com](https://www.gaeblogx.com/ "")
  * I've been wanting to use the name ["gae blog"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A1e_Bulg "") since the beginning :) but unfortunately the domain was taken by another when I first launched this blog. The domain was freed up recently so I decided to just get it and do the migration.
  * Currently the old domain will redirect to the new one with a status code 301. However the old domain will expire on 06/07/2023
* (WIP) Integration with [tina.io](https://tina.io/ ""). I was using [jekyll-admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin "") for as a traditional CMS-style GUI to author content and administer the blog. But it's only a jekyll plugin not a cloud based solution so it can't take care of authoring contents in production and making the changes on github. tina.io is a solution meant for that. So far tina has been working great locally and I am still working on deploying it to production. I am following [https://huwfulcher.com/blog/2022/how-to-integrate-tinacms-with-jekyll/](https://huwfulcher.com/blog/2022/how-to-integrate-tinacms-with-jekyll/ "") at the beginning but later made a ton of changes so I might write a dedicated post for that later.
* I've been cooking a lot lately following some video guides on youtube. It's a bit troublesome that I'll need to dig out the video and watch it again every time before I can fully memorize the recipe, so I'll probably start a new category of blog posts for cooking.
