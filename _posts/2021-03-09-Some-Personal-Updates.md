Just want to give a brief updates on my current status. I moved from Bay Area working for Arista Networks to Irvine@Orange County@SoCal
working for Amazon on Oct 2019. Part of the reasons why I haven't been updating this blog is just the work is far busier compared to
what's in Arista XD.

I'll have another post about this one and a half year journey in Amazon@Irvine, across two organizations two teams three managers.
